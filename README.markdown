# WolfAuth for Codeigniter 2.0+

WolfAuth is a role based authentication library for Codeigniter versions 2.0 and up. It's not overly complex, but will allow you to restrict access to things based on role ID's, login users, add users, edit users, delete users and lots of other stuff you would expect in an auth library.

I usually use Ion Auth in my projects, but find that even though it's well written, it feels dated and hacky. I wanted to create something that should stand the test of time, something in 2 years time that will still kick ass.

This library isn't really tested, so if you find any bugs please log and issue and I will fix it. Even better, submit a pull request and I'll implement it into the codebase.
